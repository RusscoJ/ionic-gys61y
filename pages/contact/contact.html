<h2> <b> How we made the School Helpers Calculator </b></h2>
<p> <b> The school helpers calculator was made with Stackblitz. Some codes were sourced through gitbub, ionic framework, w3schools and Wix Logo maker. The calculator can be compared to that of the BPI calculator SIP for Schools tab. It was coded with the use of the three coding languages: html, css, and javascript. By using the tuition fee amount and the payment terms, the calculator uses a solution set or formula and calculates the three needed variables. </b></p>
